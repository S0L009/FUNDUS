## Pipeline:

1. **Capturing High-Resolution Fundus Images:** Utilizing reinforcement learning for precise joystick movements to capture high-quality fundus images.
2. **Optic Disc Segmentation:** Isolating the optic disc from the captured fundus images.
3. **Glaucoma Classification:** Differentiating between glaucoma suspects and healthy individuals.
4. **Report Generation:** Creating a comprehensive report based on the classification results.
